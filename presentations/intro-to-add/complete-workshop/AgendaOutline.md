## Session 1 – Pains and "Remedies"?

- **The LLM Pain**
  - Hallucination & Data Leakage
  - Prompt Engineering Overhead
  - Limited Long-term Context Awareness
  - Cognitive Off-loading Trap
  - Big Boss: Scaling Business Complexity
  - LLM Pain in Summary
- **The Pain of the Past**
  - Overview
  - Pain Point 1: Pattern Ambiguity
  - Pain Point 2: Leaky Infrastructure
  - Pain Point 3: Costly Tech Swaps
  - Pain Point 4: Complex Domain Logic
  - Pain Point 5: Lack of Ubiquitous Language
  - Pain Point 6: Difficult Testability
- **DDD Remedies**
  - Pattern Clarity via Bounded Contexts
  - Infrastructure Isolation through Layers
  - Strategic Tech Independence
  - Ubiquitous Language Enforcement
  - Domain-centric Testing
- **Pain of DDD**
  - Steep Learning Curve
  - Heavy Tactical Patterns Overhead
  - Heavy Tactical Patterns Overhead Example
  - Complex Bounded Context Governance

## Session 2 – How ADD Fixes Them

- ADD Solution 1: Clear Actor & Abstraction Layers (fixes Pattern Ambiguity)
- ADD Solution 2: Ports shield Infrastructure (fixes Leaky Infrastructure)
- ADD Solution 3: Replaceable Adapters (fixes Costly Tech Swaps)
- ADD Solution 4: Focused Core Entities & Operators (fixes Complex Domain Logic)
- ADD Solution 5: Design Request as Ubiquitous Language (fixes Language Gap)
- ADD Solution 6: Infra-free Core for Fast Tests (fixes Testability)
- **ADD Fixes for DDD Pain**
  - Lower Entry Barrier with Actor-first Modeling (eases Learning Curve)
  - Lightweight Abstractions over Heavy Patterns (cuts Tactical Overhead)
  - AI Auto-generated Diagrams & Simple Contexts (simplifies Governance)
- **DDD vs ADD (comparison)**
