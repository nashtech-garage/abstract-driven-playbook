# Abstract Driven Development Principles

Core principles, guidelines, and best practices that define Abstract Driven Development (ADD). These principles ensure consistent, maintainable, and scalable software architecture.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](./Dependency_Inversion_Principle.md)
**Foundation of ADD Architecture**

Ensure high-level business logic modules never depend on low-level technical implementation details. Both should depend on abstractions.

**Key Benefits:**
- Technology independence
- Easy testing with mocks
- Parallel development capability
- Future-proofing against changes

**When to Apply:** Always - this is the foundation of ADD

---

### [Technology Independence](./Technology_Independence.md)
**Adaptability Principle**

Enable business logic to operate independently of specific technologies, frameworks, databases, or external services.

**Key Benefits:**
- Risk mitigation (vendor lock-in, technology debt)
- Environment flexibility
- Easy technology migration
- Business continuity

**When to Apply:** From project start, especially for long-term projects

---

### [Simplicity and KISS](./Simplicity_and_KISS.md)
**Maintainability Principle**

Keep architecture and implementation simple, consistent, and easy to understand while maintaining ADD's power and flexibility.

**Key Benefits:**
- Easy to learn and apply
- Consistent patterns across features
- Reduced complexity
- Faster development

**When to Apply:** Throughout development, resist over-engineering

---

### [Clear Layer Separation](./Clear_Layer_Separation.md)
**Architectural Discipline**

Maintain strict boundaries between the 5 ADD layers, ensuring each layer has distinct responsibilities and dependencies flow in only one direction.

**Key Benefits:**
- Maintainable codebase
- Predictable structure
- Team productivity
- Technology flexibility

**When to Apply:** Always enforce during development and code reviews

---

## 🏗️ Layering Guidelines

Detailed implementation guidelines for each ADD layer:

### [📡 Boundary Layer Guidelines](./layering/Boundary_Layer_Guidelines.md)
**External Interface Management**

Handle external communication, data contracts, and protocol translation. Focus on DTOs, controllers, validation, and API versioning.

**Responsibilities:**
- HTTP/REST/GraphQL endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Response formatting
- Authentication integration

---

### [🎯 Core Abstractions Guidelines](./layering/Core_Abstractions_Guidelines.md)
**Business Domain Definition**

Define business concepts, rules, and contracts through entities, value objects, ports, and domain events.

**Responsibilities:**
- Business entities with behavior
- Immutable value objects
- Interface contracts (ports)
- Domain events

---

### [⚙️ Operators Layer Guidelines](./layering/Operators_Layer_Guidelines.md)
**Business Logic Orchestration**

Coordinate business workflows, manage transactions, and orchestrate between Core Abstractions and external dependencies.

**Responsibilities:**
- Use case implementation
- Business workflow coordination
- Data transformation
- Event emission

---

### [🔧 Implementations Layer Guidelines](./layering/Implementations_Layer_Guidelines.md)
**Technical Implementation**

Provide concrete implementations of ports, handle external system integration, and manage technical concerns.

**Responsibilities:**
- Database access
- External API integration
- Infrastructure services
- Technical data mapping

---

### [🚀 Bootstrap Layer Guidelines](./layering/Bootstrap_Layer_Guidelines.md)
**Application Lifecycle**

Configure dependency injection, manage application startup/shutdown, and wire all layers together.

**Responsibilities:**
- Dependency injection setup
- Environment configuration
- Application initialization
- Health checks and monitoring

---

## 📋 [Implementation Best Practices](./Implementation_Best_Practices.md)
**Practical Guidance**

Proven practices for implementing ADD effectively in real-world projects, covering setup, development workflow, and evolution strategies.

**Includes:**
- Project setup and structure
- Development workflow
- Code quality standards
- Error handling strategies
- Performance considerations
- Monitoring and observability
- Migration and evolution

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### For New Projects
1. **Start with [Clear Layer Separation](./Clear_Layer_Separation.md)** - Set up proper folder structure
2. **Apply [DIP](./Dependency_Inversion_Principle.md)** - Define interfaces before implementations
3. **Follow [Simplicity](./Simplicity_and_KISS.md)** - Begin with simple solutions
4. **Plan for [Technology Independence](./Technology_Independence.md)** - Abstract external dependencies

### For Existing Projects
1. **Assess current architecture** against ADD principles
2. **Identify violations** of DIP and layer separation
3. **Create migration plan** following [Implementation Best Practices](./Implementation_Best_Practices.md)
4. **Implement gradually** to avoid disrupting existing functionality

### For Team Training
1. **Understand DIP** - The foundation concept
2. **Practice layer separation** - Hands-on exercises
3. **Apply to real scenarios** - Use team's current projects
4. **Code review together** - Identify improvements
